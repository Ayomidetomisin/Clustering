# Clustering Analysis of Online Shopper Behavior Using Two Algorithms Models
Clustering Analysisis of online shopping activity data using k - means and # pandas
This task aims to construct a clustering model classifying online shoppers based on their engagement time. I used the "Online shoppers intension"" dataset. The dataset comprises 12,330 sessions of online shopping activity over a year. I analysed the data using K- means and Hierarchical Clustering and cknowledging these considerations is crucial for the ethical and professional application of machine learning techniques, ensuring that the benefits are realized without compromising integrity or privacy. In conclusion, the clustering task aimed to identify meaningful patterns within the dataset using K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering. The selected Silhouette Score metric facilitated performance evaluation and the results revealed that Hierarchical Clustering slightly outperformed K-Means. This aligns with the task question, emphasizing the importance of appropriate clustering algorithms. The analysis underscores the validity of the proposed solution, emphasizing the significance of methodological choices in uncovering valuable insights from data.
